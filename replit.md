# Chemical Document Automation System

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that automates the processing of chemical supplier documents (COA, MSDS, TDS) and generates company-branded versions. The system extracts data from uploaded PDF documents and produces standardized, branded documents for Nano Tech Chemical Brothers Pvt. Ltd., reducing manual processing time from 4-5 hours to just minutes.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)

### Enhanced PDF Processing System
- **Date**: August 20, 2025
- **Issue**: Original PDF extraction was not capturing all pages from multi-page documents (MSDS had 6 pages, only reading 1)
- **Solution**: Enhanced PDF processor with multi-page support and OCR capabilities
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Multi-page text extraction with page-by-page processing
  - OCR fallback for image-based PDFs (like COA documents)
  - Enhanced pattern matching for Chinese supplier documents
  - Better extraction of product names, CAS numbers, INCI names, molecular formulas
  - Multi-language support (English and Chinese patterns)
  - Improved table detection for test results and specifications
- **Dependencies Added**: pytesseract, pdf2image, opencv-python, tesseract (system), poppler-utils (system)
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - OCR system fully operational
- **Results**: Successfully extracting comprehensive data from all document types:
  - MSDS: 6 pages, 11,102+ characters extracted 
  - TDS: 1 page, 1,938+ characters extracted
  - COA: 1 page, 1,289+ characters extracted
- **Data Quality**: Product names, INCI names, CAS numbers, supplier info, molecular formulas all extracting accurately
